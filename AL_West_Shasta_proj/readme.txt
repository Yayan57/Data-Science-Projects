I am only making this file to make the folder file that it is in, in github. 
While you are here though this project is very simple but is just what where 
I wanted to start with working with bs4 and pandas in order to find all the 
times in the history of the al west where their records have put them in order 
where their logos create the name Shasta (the name of the uh mascot) in descending order.
I'm not sure if this could work with any other division in baseball I could check but I believe
that the Al west is the only division in baseball where all of the main / alt logos of each team
is just a large letter. You may be asking yourself at this point why does the project start in 2013
when I said that I found all the times in the history of the AL west where the teams where in the "Shasta"
order and that is because before 2013 the astros were in the NL and so there is no way that the other teams
in the AL west could be in Shasta order. Also it would not allow me to add the virtual enviroment which
honestly makes sense but if you want to run the files on your computer you will need to create your own virtual
enviroment and run the files probably in whatever IDE you enjoy, I used Pycharm by Jet Brainsâ„¢. Thank you for
reading if you are still here and I hope you enjoy going through these projects as much as I did making them.
